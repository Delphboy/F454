## Exam Board Specificatin

## An Overview of My Project
For my F454 Project I worked alongside Vision4Children to create a Roku channel that would allow them to share media with their supporters. In order to meet the exam board's requirements I also developed an XML Editing tool with built in FTP support. This would allow the Roku channel's XML files to be easily edited without any knowledge of XML, allowing non-technical users to update the content on the Roku channel. The built-in FTP supoprt allows the edited XML files to be uploaded to the Roku channel's server directly, without the need for a 3rd party tool such as FileZilla.

## The Repository
This repository contains the source code for the XML Editor with FTP support.
